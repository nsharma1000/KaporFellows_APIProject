KaporFellows_APIProject
=======================
I created this project using the flicker API. It allows you to search for a term (ex: puppy)
and pulls up 20 results of photos with that tag. If you search for more than one term (ex: puppy and then kitten later),
the results are displayed under one another.

There is also a button for you to share a twitter or facebook update right from the application. Simpily click the "talk about it!"
button in the top, left hand corner. Make sure you are logged into your respective twitter or facebook account on your
Apple device for this to work.

To use, simpily download the zip file and run in xcode. Note that the "Kapor Fellows.xcodeproj" and "KaporFellowship.
xcodeproj" are the same file. You can view the application using either file. (Not sure why both files were pushed to Github)

If you have any questions, feel free to email me at snisha@umich.edu :)
